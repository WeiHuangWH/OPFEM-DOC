# Introduction

As a Python-based finite element modeling software, OPFEM is designed to provide a flexible and accessible tool for finite element analysis in various engineering and scientific applications. This page provides a brief introduction to the basic usage of OPFEM.

## Objectives of OPFEM

Although there are already many open-source CAE software available, from different aspects, like FreeCAD in CAD, OpenFOAM in CFD, and OpenSees in structural analysis, we still find it is not easy to really get into the door of deleoping an open-source CAE software. What I mean is that, as researcheres with a background of computaional mechanics, I haven't really got a trainning of completed system of software engineering. Although we're able to understand mutli-scale computational mechanics theory, deducing the heterogenous multiscale method, and even developing a new finite element method, we don't really know how to merge our methods to the real world, use them to solve practical problems in a more non-fiction way and contribute to the open-source communitiy. There are lots of reaseraches in the field who develop their advanced computational methods, but they can only share their work with the academic community by publishing papers. As members of this group, We hope to collaborate with other researchers in various fields to develop a more practical and useful open-source software, which can be used by more people in the world.

From this point of view, we initiate the project of OPFEM. As a group of people who don't have the background of computer science and software engineering, everything are really started from the scratch. We want to understand every details of how to develop a usable open-source FEM software, thus we start from basic tools like OpencasCade, Qt, and VTK. Although they are not the lowest bottom layer like OpenGL, we think they are enough for us to get started.

From this project, we hope to achieve the following objectives:
- Develop a usable open-source FEM software, which can be used by more people in the world.
- Create a platform for researchers from different fields to collaborate and share their work.
- Provide an example for other researchers and students, especially those who have the same background as us, to get started with the development of open-source CAE software.

Therefore, we would like to record the whole development process and share our experience with others in different manners, maybe blogs, videos or online meetings. Discussions and suggestions are always welcome. We hope that more people can join us and contribute to this project.

## About our team

We are a group of researchers from the School of Civil Engineering at Wuhan University. Our research background is mainly in the field of solid and computational mechanics. Although we are interested in the development of finite element methods, we are still learining various basic knowledge in the fields of computer science and software engineering. We hope that OPFEM can be a good start for us to learn and practice the development of open-source software.
